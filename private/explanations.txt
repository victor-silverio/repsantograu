1. Contrast 

Answer: Although it might not appear so, the contrast is fine and legible, scoring 100 on the Lighthouse test.

2. Heavy and slow photos.html 

Answer: Its purpose does not require fast loading speeds; it is strictly a page for displaying house photos. Therefore, there is no need for quality reduction or other optimizations for fast loading.

3. 'Stale-While-Revalidate' Cache 

Answer: To avoid serving an outdated page for too long, the version declared in the service worker is changed with every relevant alteration. Additionally, it is updated by update_script.py if there are any changes to the HTML pages.

4. General Cache 

Answer: Images have a 1-year cache policy since they are static. If there is any change, however unlikely, I use the trick of changing the extension to .webp?v=1 to refresh the general cache.

5. Declared 'unsafe-inline' 

Answer: Even with the external styles.css, I still use some minimal CSS classes within the pages, which is why I keep it declared. For my site's level, this is not a significant security vulnerability.

6. Cloudflare Cache 

Answer: There is an automation linked to the Azure deploy that clears the cache on Cloudflare servers after every successful deployment.
